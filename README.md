#AxiDraw Python driver
An alternative AxiDraw CLI for python because it seemed fun to make!
Why use my driver instead of the [original](https://github.com/evil-mad/axidraw/tree/master/cli), by Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories, or [Michael Fogleman's](https://github.com/fogleman/axi)? Admittedly, mine is less developed. For now, use for it's simplicity. Later, I plan to add functionality to handle interrupted plots.

##Credits
While the higher level functionality is my work, the lower level features (default AxiDraw settings, structure of the command function, and plot error correction) are very heavily influenced by the Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories' and Michael Fogleman's drivers.

##Usage
To use, create an instance of the AxiCLI class (in driver.py). The functions for drawing should be self documenting.
